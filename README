Infrared absorption bands of interstellar dust 

Full theory of work with links contains in report.

For changing input parameters you should edit constants.f95


Data about scattering index of ice I got from 
Hudgins et. al., Mid and Far infrared spectrscopy of ices Astrophys.J.Suppl. 86:713-870, 1993 June
The head of "esp_ice.dat" is
 lambda(cm^-1) --- n ---- k
 
 
Data about astronomical silicate I get from Draine (1985) Astrophys.J.Suppl. 57, 587.
The head of "eps_sil.dat" is 
lamda(mkm) ------ esp1 ------ eps2 ------ n-1---- k eps = dielectic coefficients



After that I interpolated this data to same GRID with interpolation module writed on octave and put it on data2.txt

The head of "data2.txt"

lambda(mkm) n_ice, k _ice , n_sil, k_sil




You can change data about ice and silicate, but after that you should change interpolation rules. 
It`s not difficult with octave 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!! After change num you should rebuild data2.txt with octave	  	   !!!!
!!	you should put in command line this string "octave interpolation.m"!!!!
!!																	   !!!!
!!	then you should replace NA to nearest value in data2.txt		   !!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First of all you should run 'make' in you command line
For run it you should type 'make run'
For make graphics from result data you should run 'make plot' 

You'll get result for prolate particle, you can change just several functions in 'subfun.f95' 
with agree to theory for get rusult for oblate case.   

Get fun ^^
