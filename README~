Full theory of work with links contains in report.

For changing input parameters you should edit constants.f95



Data about scattering index of ice I got from paper in folder papers
The head of "esp_ice.dat" is
 lambda(cm^-1) --- n ---- k
 
 
Data about silicate I get from Draine (1985) Astrophys.J.Suppl. 57, 587.
The head of "eps_sil.dat" is 
lamda(mkm) ------ esp1 ------ eps2 ------ n-1---- k eps = dielectic coefficients

After that I interpolated this data to same GRID with interpolation module writed on octave
and put it on data2.txt

The head of "data2.txt"

lambda(mkm) n_ice, k _ice , n_sil, k_sil

ou can change data about ice and silicate, but after it you should change interpolation rules. 
It`s not difficult with octave 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!! A	fter change num you should rebuild data2.txt with octave	   !!!!
!!	you should put in command line this string "octave interpolation.m"!!!!
!!																	   !!!!
!!	then you should replace NA to nearest value in data2.txt		   !!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First of all you should run 'make' in you command line
For run it you should type 'make run'
For make graphics from result data you should run 'make plot' 

Get fun ^^
